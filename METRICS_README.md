## 🎓 Key Concepts

### The 3 Metrics That Matter Most

1. **Average Precision (AP): 0.0272**
   - Measures overall ranking quality
   - Your score is 117% better than random
   - ✅ GOOD

2. **Precision @ 1%: 7.32%**
   - Of top 1% flagged accounts, 7.32% are fraudulent
   - 6x better than random investigation
   - ✅ EXCELLENT

3. **Coverage @ 1%: 9.42%**
   - Detects 9% of fraud schemes by checking 1% of accounts
   - ⚠️ MODERATE (room for improvement)

### Top 3 Methods to Deploy

| Rank | Method | Best For | Status |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| 🥇 | **pagerank_wlog** | Overall performance | ✅ Deploy |
| 🥈 | **in_deg** | Speed + simplicity | ✅ Deploy |
| 🥉 | **ensemble_top3** | Robustness | ✅ Deploy |

## 🎯 TL;DR - The Bottom Line

### What Works ✅
- **pagerank_wlog**: Best overall (AP=0.0272, P@1%=7.32%)
- **in_deg**: Fastest, nearly as good (AP=0.0260, P@1%=7.32%)
- **ensemble_top3**: Most robust (AP=0.0253, P@1%=7.45%)
- **Graph structure**: Far better than amount-based features
- **Longer windows**: 7-day better than 3-day

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **pattern_features**: Actively harmful (-25% performance)
- **Amount-only methods**: Not discriminative enough
- **HITS algorithm**: No better than random
- **Community detection**: Too granular (24k communities)
- **Collector/distributor ratios**: Worse than random

### Key Insight 💡
**Money laundering is primarily an aggregation problem.** Simple graph topology (who connects to whom) beats complex heuristics and transaction amounts.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is 7.32% precision good enough?**  
A: Yes! With only 1.25% fraud prevalence, achieving 7.32% precision means you're 6x more efficient than random. 93% false positives is normal for fraud detection.

**Q: Why only 9% coverage?**  
A: Different schemes have different patterns. A single method can't catch everything. Use ensemble approaches and continue research.

**Q: Should I use pagerank_wlog or in_deg?**  
A: PageRank is slightly better (0.0272 vs 0.0260 AP), but in_deg is much faster and simpler. For real-time: in_deg. For batch: pagerank_wlog. For production: ensemble_top3.

**Q: Why did pattern_features fail?**  
A: Hand-crafted heuristics don't capture the complexity of real laundering patterns. Graph structure alone works better.

**Q: Can this be improved?**  
A: Yes! Graph Neural Networks, temporal features, and more labeled data could push P@1% to 10-12%.
