- Neo4j Database (with Graph Data Science plugin for Louvain algorithm)
- Redis Server
- Streamlit (for dashboard)

## Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start Services
```bash
# Start Redis
brew services start redis

# Start Neo4j with GDS plugin
brew services start neo4j
```

### 3. Configure Environment
Copy and update the environment file:
```bash
cp example.env .env
```

Default configuration:
```
NEO4J_URI=neo4j://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=password
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_DB=0
```

## Running the System

### Step 1: Generate Data
```bash
python data_generator.py
```
Creates accounts and transactions with realistic behavioral patterns.

### Step 2: Start Ingestion Engine
```bash
python ingestion_engine.py
```
Connects to Redis and Neo4j, ready to process transactions.

### Step 3: Stream Transactions (new terminal)
```bash
python stream_simulator.py
```
Simulates real-time transaction flow.

### Step 4: Feature Engineering
This script connects to Neo4j, extracts graph and transactional features for each account, and saves them to a CSV file.

```bash
python feature_engineering.py
```

### Step 5: Production-Ready Feature Engineering
Extract behavioral features without using fraud flags (production deployment ready):

```bash
python feature_engineering.py
```

This creates:
- `account_features.csv` - Production features (39 behavioral patterns)
- `evaluation_dataset.csv` - Evaluation dataset with ground truth labels

### Step 6: Anomaly Detection
Apply machine learning algorithms to detect fraud patterns:

```bash
# Local Outlier Factor (recommended for fraud detection)
python anomaly_detection.py --algorithm lof --contamination 0.05

# Isolation Forest (for baseline comparison)
python anomaly_detection.py --algorithm isolation_forest
```

### Step 7: Community Detection
Identify suspicious account clusters using Louvain algorithm:

```bash
python community_detection.py
```

### Step 8: Local Outlier Factor within Communities
Apply targeted anomaly detection within each community:

```bash
python local_outlier_factor.py
```

### Step 9: Launch the Investigation Dashboard
Interactive fraud investigation interface:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## Transaction Types Generated

The data generator creates a mix of legitimate and fraudulent transaction types, each with a unique `fraud_flag`.

- **Legitimate Transactions**:
  - `NORMAL`: Standard peer-to-peer or consumer transactions.
  - `NORMAL_SALARY`: Bulk salary payments from businesses to individuals on specific days of the month.
  - `NORMAL_MICRO`: Small, frequent payments for everyday items like coffee or transport.
  - `NORMAL_B2B`: High-value transfers between business accounts during business hours.
- **Fraudulent Transactions**:
  - `SMURFING_VICTIM_TRANSFER`: The initial large transfer from a victim to a mule account.
  - `SMURFING_DISTRIBUTION`: The subsequent distribution of stolen funds from a central mule to other mules in the ring.
  - `SMURFING_CASH_OUT`: The final transfer from a mule to a high-risk service (e.g., crypto exchange) to withdraw the funds.
  - `CIRCULAR_PAYMENT`: Transactions that form a closed loop between high-risk accounts to launder money.

brew services list | grep neo4j

# Restart if needed
brew services restart neo4j
```

**Redis Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Start Redis server
redis-server

# Check Redis connectivity
redis-cli ping
```

**Missing Features Warning:**
Some features may show as missing if the transaction data doesn't include all temporal or device fields. This is expected and doesn't affect core functionality.

**Performance Issues:**
For large datasets, consider:
- Increasing Neo4j memory allocation
- Using database indexes for frequently queried properties
- Implementing batch processing for feature engineering

**Neo4j Password Reset:**
```bash
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p neo4j "ALTER USER neo4j SET PASSWORD 'password'"
```
