# Money Laundering Detection Metrics - Comprehensive Guide

## Executive Summary

This document explains all metrics used in the money laundering detection system based on graph analysis of financial transactions. The analysis uses a **sliding time window approach** (3-day and 7-day windows) to detect suspicious accounts involved in money laundering schemes.

### Key Performance Indicators (Best Results)

**7-day windows - Top performing methods:**
- **pagerank_wlog**: AP=0.0272, P@1%=7.32%
- **in_deg**: AP=0.0260, P@1%=7.32%
- **ensemble_top3**: AP=0.0253, P@1%=7.45%

**Random baseline:** AP=0.0125, P@1%=1.25%

**Key Finding:** Best methods achieve ~2.4x better average precision and ~6x better precision at top 1% compared to random.

## 1. Core Evaluation Metrics

### 1.1 Average Precision (AP)
**What it is:** The area under the precision-recall curve, representing overall ranking quality.

**Range:** 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)

**Interpretation:**
- **0.01-0.03**: Typical range in this dataset (low prevalence of laundering)
- **>0.025**: Good performance
- **~0.012**: Random baseline

**Why it matters:** This is the **MOST IMPORTANT** overall metric. It measures how well the method ranks ALL laundering accounts above legitimate ones, regardless of threshold.

**Your results:**
- Best method (pagerank_wlog): **0.0272** ✅ **GOOD**
- Improvement over random: **117.4%** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

### 1.2 Precision at K (P@K)
**What it is:** Percentage of truly fraudulent accounts in the top K% of ranked accounts.

**Variations measured:**
- `p_at_0.5pct`: Top 0.5% of accounts
- `p_at_1.0pct`: Top 1% of accounts (most commonly reported)
- `p_at_2.0pct`: Top 2% of accounts
- `p_at_5.0pct`: Top 5% of accounts

**Interpretation:**
- **Random baseline:** ~1.25% (equal to prevalence)
- **Good performance:** 5-8%
- **Excellent:** >8%

**Why it matters:** In practice, investigators can only check a small percentage of accounts. P@1% tells you: "If I investigate the top 1% flagged accounts, what % will actually be fraudulent?"

**Your results (P@1%):**
- pagerank_wlog: **7.32%** ✅ **GOOD** (5.9x lift over baseline)
- in_deg: **7.32%** ✅ **GOOD**
- Random: **1.25%** (baseline)

### 1.3 Lift at K
**Formula:** `(P@K / prevalence)`

**What it is:** How many times better than random selection.

**Your results:**
- Best lift: **5.9x** at 1% threshold ✅ **GOOD**
- This means investigators are ~6x more efficient using the model

**Interpretation:**
- **1.0x**: No better than random
- **2-3x**: Modest improvement
- **5-10x**: Very good ✅ **You are here**
- **>10x**: Exceptional

### 1.4 Attempt Coverage at K
**What it is:** Percentage of laundering schemes detected by catching at least one account in the top K%.

**Why it matters:** Laundering typically involves multiple accounts working together. Catching ANY account in a scheme can unravel the entire operation.

**Your results (Coverage@1%):**
- in_deg: **9.42%** ✅ **GOOD**
- pagerank_wlog: **2.38%** (lower, but still valuable)

**Interpretation:**
- Catching ~9% of schemes by investigating only 1% of accounts is effective
- Different methods catch different schemes (ensemble benefit)

## 7. Performance Context: Are These Results Good?

### **YES, these are good results given:**

1. **Extremely Low Prevalence** (1.25%)
   - In such imbalanced problems, even small improvements matter
   - 6x lift is significant

2. **Real-world Applicability**
   - Investigating 1% of accounts catches 7.3% of launderers
   - Dramatic efficiency gain for investigators

3. **Novel Problem**
   - This is an academic research project on synthetic but realistic data
   - Results show clear signal above noise

4. **Comparison to Random**
   - Random: AP=0.0125, P@1%=1.25%
   - Best: AP=0.0272, P@1%=7.32%
   - **117% improvement in AP, 485% in P@1%**

### **Where There's Room for Improvement:**

1. **Coverage is Low** (2-9% at 1% threshold)
   - Missing 90%+ of schemes
   - Need ensemble approaches targeting different scheme types

2. **Absolute Precision Still Low** (7% at top 1%)
   - 93% false positive rate at top percentile
   - But this is 6x better than random investigation

3. **Pattern Features Failed**
   - Expected them to help but they hurt
   - Need better feature engineering or ML approaches

## 8. Key Insights from Results

### **What Works:**
- ✅ Simple degree-based features (in_deg, out_deg)
- ✅ PageRank variants
- ✅ Ensembles of top methods
- ✅ Longer time windows (7-day better than 3-day)

### **What Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ Complex pattern features
- ❌ Amount-based features alone
- ❌ HITS algorithm
- ❌ Community-based detection (in current form)
- ❌ Pure collector/distributor heuristics

### **Surprising Findings:**
1. **Simple in_deg performs as well as sophisticated PageRank**
   - Suggests laundering aggregation is the key signal
   
2. **Pattern features hurt performance**
   - Hand-crafted heuristics are worse than graph structure
   
3. **Amount matters less than structure**
   - Transaction graph topology > transaction amounts
   
4. **Community detection too granular**
   - 24k communities for 113k nodes = over-fragmentation
